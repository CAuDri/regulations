\chapter{Dynamic Events}

During the dynamic events, the actual performance of the automated model
vehicles will be challenged in two different disciplines (Free Drive and
Parking, Obstacle Evasion Course). Parking maneuvers are performed in a
distinctive parking zone following the starting line during the “Free Drive”
discipline. The additional elements of the “Obstacle Evasion Course” combine
the rural road scenario with challenges of suburban scenarios.

\section{Referees}

Referees around the track are evaluating each vehicle’s performance and will be
responsible for registering violations. Team referees are nominated by every
team to support the scoring during the dynamic events. Teams consisting of less
than five members present during the dynamic events can choose to refrain from
providing a referee. During dynamic events, team referees are the spokesperson
for the commission and the official referees. Team referees are expected to
approve the compliance of the track prior to the start of the individual
discipline. Then, they will be asked to join a referee in observing a specific
section of the track. The team referee has to stand back, while their own
vehicle is on the track.
