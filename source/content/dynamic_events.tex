\chapter{Dynamic Events}

\begin{highlight}
During the dynamic events, the actual performance of the automated model
vehicles will be challenged in multiple disciplines:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Free Drive Course
    \item Obstacle Evasion Course
    \item Navigation Course
\end{itemize}
Parking maneuvers are performed in a distinctive parking zone during the
"Obstacle Evasion Course”. The additional elements of
the “Obstacle Evasion Course” and "Navigation Course" combine the rural road scenario with challenges
of suburban scenarios.
\end{highlight}

\section{Referees}

Referees around the track are evaluating each vehicle’s performance and will be
responsible for registering violations. Team referees are nominated by every
team to support the scoring during the dynamic events. Teams consisting of less
than five members present during the dynamic events can choose to refrain from
providing a referee. During dynamic events, team referees are the spokesperson
for the commission and the official referees. Team referees are expected to
approve the compliance of the track prior to the start of the individual
discipline. Then, they will be asked to join a referee in observing a specific
section of the track.
