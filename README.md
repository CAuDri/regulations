# CAuDri-Challenge Regulations

This repository contains the source files for the official regulations of the CAuDri-Challenge. 

You can always find the current version in the [Releases](https://github.com/CAuDri/regulations/releases) section or on our [website](https://caudri-challenge.de/regulations).

## Contributing

There will be a main development branch for each competition (e.g. "regulations_2025"). 
Create a new branch from this development branch for your changes and merge them back into the development branch via a pull request.

A commit to the main branch will trigger the generation of a new release, which will be published on our website. This should be thoroughly tested before merging.

New features and differences to the previous competition must be highlighted in yellow.
Differences to the initial release of the same year will be highlighted in green.
